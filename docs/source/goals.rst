Goals
=====

Near Term
---------

- Highlight which application logs are the most problematic the administrators should be alerted to take action. This can reduce outage time.

Far Term
--------
- Once we know what behavior is abnormal can we take action to remediate the issue? Or when we get warning signs can we take pre-emptive actions? This is a stretch goal in the horizon for the future of this project. But out of scope at this time.
